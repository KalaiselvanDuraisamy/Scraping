shopping i am wondering what you think of etsy and how it compares reply theabundantartist says february at pm susie that s a great question one of the big reasons that i like big cartel is that they allow you to embed the shopping experience right on your own site if etsy does that i m not aware of that feature reply andrew wilson says august at pm give https ezzl art a try it s website for artists with e commerce built directly in quite a bit different than bigcartel reply hillary seltzer says february at am looking forward to going through this blog reply lisa mindfulbiz says february at pm it s easy to forget when working on your artist website that it s your primary tool for marketing and selling your art online the purpose is to make it easy for potential customers to connect with you and buy your art you need to think about what you want people to do when they visit your website i noticed a lack of an obvious mailing list sign up on some of these websites a regular newsletter is a great way to stay in touch with potential customers and it s a call to action that a website visitor can take as a first step to connect with you it s unlikely a person who s never seen your work before will buy a piece of art on the first visit give website visitors a chance to give you their email address so you can stay in touch i was curious and took a quick peek at all of the websites matt leblanc s website gave me the best first impression reply theabundantartist says february at pm lisa great point in the newsletter opt in i looked at literally hundreds of websites in prepping for this post and these were among the best that i could find overall thanks for the comment reply mark mcguinness says march at am thanks for compiling this cory great selection i agree with lisa that getting visitors to do something should be a priority for artists and offering a newsletter opt in is a little thing that could make a big difference to the bottom line the sites all look fabulous so the artists have done a lot of the hard work adding a newsletter opt in and writing a good newsletter will help them earn a payoff for that work reply robert betsch says january at am thank you everything i m on the verge of opening an art gallery site and was wondering to i need a wix site and wordpress best robert reply josie weir says july at am i like ann rea s work and her user friendly website josie weir http josie weir artistwebsites com index html reply swarezart says july at am yeah i reckon i got a pretty decent one too http www swarez co uk reply matthew says july

july at am swarezart indeed your site is beautiful discovered a new wp theme developer too thanks for stopping by reply jackthepoet says july at am nice list but i need more some art news or something like this website reply fieldeyart says september at am thanks for the great post last week i was researching artist websites before i started my own and i have to agree that they are by and large badly designed i couldn t find many inspirational sites out there and these are artists we re talking about i expected to find creative and beautifully crafted sites after reading your post and checking out other artist websites i spent the weekend feverishly coding scribbling and photographing trying to create a website that had a custom look and was immediately obvious what i do and here is the end result http www fieldey com thanks for providing inspiration reply alan magnani says december at pm i m just starting out and the tips were helpful reply andrew tjandra says march at am these websites look a bit outdated to be honest with you i personally really like the redesign of postertext com clean functional and it s obvious that effort was made to put the attention on the art prints rather than on the website itself reply patrice says april at pm i would appreciate any advice you may have on my website also feel free to critique my work paintingsbypatrice com the opening page has a red heart i am nor ally the first website with that exact name reply brennen mcelhaney says august at am cory thank you for posting this resource of great artist websites i ve referred to it several times i recently came across a beautiful and rich website that highlights studio visits to west coast artists http inthemake com consequently i was inspired to create on my artist website a studio visit page and an en plein air page with lots of photos and an interview http bmcelhaney com art artist studio visit http bmcelhaney com art artist en plein air reply cory huff says august at am nicely done brennan looks really good reply olivia j says november at pm hello im olivia jones an upcoming and aspiring artist i really enjoyed reading this insightful article and will definitely

drawn to ann rea s website straight away because of the picture on the front page that s always what gets me a picture i think my website may possibly be a complete disaster i m not business savvy at all what i really wish i could get was some feedback on my website i m mortified to discover that the contact form i have on my website is probably making me look unfriendly or at worst untrustworthy i thought i d made it easy and straightforward reply john hogan says january at pm its always best to keep it simple and don t forget nowadays most people over and growing view the internet via mobile devices only and so make sure your site is mobile friendly specialist business orientated sites have this facility as standard because they know reply hanine abdelkader says april at pm i have a talent in drawing and i would like to get involved in clubs how can i reminded please help me reply gina says june at am thanks for sharing reply todd baxter dawson says august at pm i d be interested in your response to my own website http www toddbaxterdawson com perhaps it would make the next list of recommended sites i d also suggest walter matia s site http www matia com in addition to being a fine artist i also design websites such as mr matia s reply dd duvall says september at am thank you for this resource as i work to startup my own website i use wix website address is http www ddduvall com and have found they are very helpful i m hoping to incorporate an e commerce feature soon but have wondered how effective it might be does anyone have a sense for how effective purchasing is in the digital market as opposed to actually meeting the artist in person etc i have found so far that people want to feel a connection to the artist or to the art but i m a novice at this so maybe i m completely wrong thank you again reply gapsel says september at am all of them are great thanks for sharing with us reply sun says october at pm i do like her websites and am wondering if she hired someone or by herself if i can get some information how to get website like her thank you http melissasmithart com product pet portrait painting reply hughsieg says november at am hi sun melissa

was just looking at my analytics and i get a ton of hits directed to my site from your website thank you for the shout out and for helping other artists build their brands and get noticed keep up the good work warmest regards kelli reply lois says june at pm i used square space to create my site the e com tab is hidden but can be active it was just published so i welcome your advice and feedback

them up in your home i included some real pictures to give ya ll a better perspective on if they would work in your home i like them e supsekens reply dan sieger says august at pm hopefully one day my art website will be like amber jeans reply andrew wielawski says september at am there are a few ways beyond having a compelling website to draw traffic to your work sure etsy and cartel will do wonders but it will help if you make yourself into a recognized quantity first one way to do this is to self publish a book on amazon that makes people want to search for you on the web andrew weindling did this with a book called twister which is nothing more than tales of his artistic successes and failures after reading it i couldn t help but click to find out who this guy was great book but he doesn t have a website but if he did wow reply emergart says march at pm the article is fine but i want to know about more artists better then those mentioned above thank you reply mary says july at pm ann rea website is not good can t see her paintings and you must send away for her guide i guess before you can see anything else too bad don t like to be forced to sign up for anything
