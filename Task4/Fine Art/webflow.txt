designed in webflow jeff cardello november inspiration addthis sharing buttons share to facebook share to twitter share to pinterest share to email there s a reason those drawn to the visual arts use webflow much like a blank piece of paper and a case of colored pens webflow gives you the freedom to express your creativity but in pixels here are nine art related websites all using webflow in their own unique ways kate o sullivan let s face it autoplaying background videos isn t always the right choice but on kate o sullivan s website the featured video really serves to communicate her artistic style we see her creative process in a timelapse video showing her arms in a flurry of strokes layering paint and adding details to her animal portraits this website showcases the stylized oil paintings of her animal subjects with almost every page highlighting an aspect of her artistic talent webflow cms makes it easy to manage galleries of her featured artworks the site design is minimalistic but uses dynamic touches like subtle animations and a fade in effect revealing both text and images on scroll this site is a great source of inspiration for any visual artist check out katie o sullivan s showcase page to see how it was made r a r e digital art collection digital technology has made sharing music videos and images lightning fast and often free the downside of this is the devaluation of art artists are missing out on receiving royalties on their work r a r e is a startup that uses blockchain technology to help artists sell limited editions of their digital works it s a novel concept and the site s landing page explains the token based system in four steps both the golden bronze color palette and their seven sided polygon logo brings to mind coins and precious metals this design has a modern aesthetic that reflects the type of artists featured and likely appeals to people willing to unconventionally invest in art to see how the r a r e website came together take a look at its showcase page asheville art museum the first thing anyone wants to know when planning a trip to a museum are its current exhibitions and events the asheville art museum site features events on the hero section of their landing page scrolling brings you to a split screen one side is dedicated to upcoming events and the other displays museum news scrolling further reveals a gallery block with images from the museum s current exhibitions the design does a great job using their galleries to both show and tell what s happening the gallery is managed with webflow cms a smart move navigation is easy with only three options explore visit and support that each lead to uncluttered drop downs museum hours for the current day are found at the top of the page which may seem minor but how many of us have showed up only to have our artsy aspirations crushed by a sign that says they re closed on mondays if you re designing a site for a gallery or a museum check out how this came together in webflow gaffa creative precinct gaffa creative precinct offers art studio spaces events and classes in sydney australia right from the opening animation that propels the letters of gaffa to the foreground there s something a bit delightfully off kilter about this design though it doesn t completely break from standard design protocols there are many small eccentric touches for instance instead of being neatly lined along the top of the landing page the nav options float up from the bottom and lock into place with a downward scroll it s subtle but tells us gaffa values doing things just a bit differently checkout gaffa s showcase page in webflow becca hillburn becca hilburn creates comics and other illustrative art digitally but primarily in watercolor her characters have a cartoon like familiarity with an anime influence she skillfully uses the fluid medium of watercolor to create characters whose expressions are specific and expressive the site has a minimal layout built on webflow s free newport template but her artwork with its splashes of watercolor on thick paper gives the design a very organic feel this is another example of an artist letting their work speak for them instead of adding a bunch of excessive design ornamentation unleash your creativity on the web build completely custom production ready websites or ultra high fidelity prototypes

sturdy in the strength of the animals it features and the wood it was carved from text describing each piece overlaps photographs of featured artwork a design touch that links the cerebral to the visual this one page design puts alistair s art and talent front and center with a single scroll david tinapple i must confess i m a huge fan of digital art especially interactive installations that combine visuals and sound david tinapple an associate professor at arizona state university is an artist researcher and teacher whose work uses tools like max msp an object oriented programming language sensor data and other technology among other innovative pieces david made his own faceflip installation before face swap existed the site is a great example of how webflow regardless of your medium or interest provides a great platform to promote your work david s site design is minimal but full of examples of his work and helpful content about the technology he uses for those in the mainstream interactive digital artworks may be an esoteric area of interest but for those who love to nerd out when technology art and sound come together david s work will be well appreciated white art walk this site design for white art walk a french art walk and studio tour is a work of art unto itself the typography white brick background and black and white palette makes you feel like you re

of information about its workshops and participating artists scrolling down the landing page brings you to a grid of workshops with the feel of old black and white photos all managed with webflow cms
