uses generous whitespace large type and several other user experience best practices to make his artwork the star of the show now that you ve seen a number of different ways to build a website let s quickly discuss the main things you will want to consider when choosing a website builder choosing the right platform for your artist website the editor experience there are two types of website builders template builders and wysiwyg editors what you see is what you get to make the decision first ask yourself how much control do i want over my design minimal amount of control template builders website builders like squarespace have made it pretty easy to get a visually appealing portfolio online essentially you pick a template and fill in the blanks although you get to see the page you are editing you can t move elements freely you need to respect the predetermined grid based on the template you ve selected here s a quick example of how this works whether you decide to choose squarespace pixpa carbonmade or portfoliobox you will have a similar experience to this one essentially with template builders you are trading creative freedom in exchange for pre built structure that s pretty hard to mess up full control wysiwyg editors pagecloud wix and webflow are the three main contenders in this category unless you are very familiar with tools like photoshop we d recommend avoiding webflow as the interface is much more complex than pagecloud and wix webflow is geared towards professional designers who already have a strong understanding of website coding wix and pagecloud have a lot of similarities however pagecloud is more intuitive and less cluttered than wix this can make it easier for beginners who are building a site for the first time also the fact that pagecloud gives full access to your website s source code html css javascript makes it a scalable solution down the road if you ever wanted to work with an agency or do something outside the box here s a quick look at pagecloud s user interface choice of templates when it comes to templates there is no shortage of options both template based and wysiwyg builders offer multiple starting layouts here are a few examples to showcase the variety of available options squarespace template example pagecloud template example wix template example the cool thing about wysiwyg templates is that they can evolve over time while their rigid template based counterparts tend to keep the same look and take more work to modify one thing to note is that most artists prefer to have custom websites that represent their brand because of this artists building their own sites tend to favor wysiwyg tools features and applications depending on your website s requirements you may need additional features like e commerce while some platforms like wix and squarespace have e commerce baked in certain platforms use third party integrations to provide this functionality for example pagecloud makes it easy to integrate with over different apps like ecwid and shopify to help you sell your art online in reality you can spend hours comparing features between site builders however since requirements for artist websites are relatively low all the website builders mentioned in this article will be able to provide what is required it really comes down to the experience you will have while building and managing your website support unless you have built websites before it s important to consider what support is offered by the tool you decide to use almost all platforms mentioned above offer different levels of support based on the price of your plan ranging from a few dollars a month to close to per month note unlike most website builders pagecloud gives you full access to support even
