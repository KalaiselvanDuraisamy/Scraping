 mechanical painting laptop mechanical painting laptop enamel on steel x cm on view at deitch gallery new york until november online exhibition at site gallery sheffield site gallery is delighted to be collaborating with rafa l rozendaal on a commission and his first uk solo exhibition websites due to open september in the lead up to his exhibition rozendaal will release new works every two months exclusively on site gallery s website the first work is titled noneither in rafa l s words i make websites as artworks they are concise moving images generative random colorful moody i hope i started making websites in the internet was a great place then the early days before the web became corporate it was an optimistic time full of promise it was very exciting my idea was simple i did not want to make a website that showed irl documentation i wanted to make websites that take advantage of the possibilities of the browser these works are generative moving images they are not videos or animations they are code based algorithms they behave like a fountain or waterfall always doing the same thing but never repeating itself since i ve made about websites each in their own domain name com the domain name is the title of the work and at the same time it s the location of the work domain names are easy to remember so whenever you want to see one of my works all you have to do is remember a domain name i have exhibited my websites in physical space sometimes in galleries or museums and sometimes on digital billboards in public space i think websites should behave like gas they can fill up any potential space whether you are seeing my work on a smartwatch or on a meter billboard each instance of the work is an authentic viewing experience the work exists in infinite multitudes any place any time as long as you have an internet connection for the exhibition websites which will launch at site gallery in september i am making a new group of concise moving images the exhibition was supposed to launch in but covid ironically my work has always suited a locked down life now that we spend much more time at home it seemed like a good idea to launch the works on the web first and show them later in installation form at site gallery these works are dead ends there are no links there is no information there is only movement you are presented with these works and once you are there all you can do is stare quiet calm staring online exhibition at upstream gallery upstream gallery proudly presents its online platform upstream gallery dedicated to host a new series of online exhibitions these exhibitions will be developed curated and participated by artists that belong to the top of the digital art world the first exhibition is curated by rafae l rozendaal quiet calm staring participating artists claude closky constant dullaart jodi olia lialina jan robert leegte peter luining jonas lund guthrie lonergan jonathan puckey moniker evan roth claudia mate michael manning rafae l rozendaal we have been online before the crisis and we ll be here after for this first exhibition rafae l rozendaal made a selection of artists who use websites as a medium he chose to select websites that require no interaction websites that are endpoints no information no links they are destinations as the artist mentions art is a place for reflection and contemplation quiet calm staring trying to observe without too many thoughts we are used to viewing art that way but the internet is a different place the internet is fast paced jumping from link to link from impression to impression websites are ubique ubiquitous objects they can exist in many places simultaneously it might sound obvious and we take it for granted but i think now more than ever we understand why websites are a very special place for artists to make work websites are different from any other medium they use computational processes to generate living moving images browsing them has it s own rhythm it s own flow of time different from video tv or cinema rr haiku alone at the pool swimming by myself nobody else discrete objects at upstream gallery discrete objects
