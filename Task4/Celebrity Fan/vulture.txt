websites by dan reilly these days an actor doesn t really need an official website it may be a half decent way to promote a charity update fans on a passion project or shill a lifestyle brand but isn t that why we have twitter and instagram even so a surprising number of actors from the a list on down still maintain their own sites which range from oddly elaborate to the stuff of geocities fever dreams with apologies to the celebs and their social media managers vulture compiled this roundup of the strangest much like the scottish actor connery s site hasn t done anything new since the league of extraordinary gentlemen hit theaters in you can still see some of his wife s art and download a bond themed screensaver provided your computer runs windows or higher talk about an opening salvo cruise s site blasts a loop of tangerine dream s love on a real train the song that played during the sex on a train scene in risky business despite that eyebrow raising flourish cruise and co haven t made any noticeable updates since here s what you ll find seventy two pages of very enthusiastic news items including one edge of tomorrow promotion that begins with warning this will be an epic blog here s what you won t any mentions of scientology or l ron hubbard worry not john travolta s site has a links of interest section that promotes scientology and dianetics the real prizes though are the photos the site features a variety in your face headshots and there s also a rare selection of images that includes a real gem of travolta playing the violin so young so handsome so gifted at the bottom of sir ian s very plain page you ll find this tidbit he has been an innovator on the internet with one of the earliest official sites for an actor mckellen com launched on september in he began publishing a series of journal entries that evolved into one of the earliest non technical blogs mckellen wrote blog entries and answered fan mail until late around the same time his site took on its simple mobile friendly layout it looks quite dated but it s still regularly updated cut gandalf some slack billybobapalooza has served fans with all things billy bob since august if you don t believe this ancient looking page is legit you can click to hear billy bob holler you a welcome to his site which leads to an mp of the actor s very own confirmation though the site lacks polish it makes up for it with updates there s news a plenty about bad santa as well as thornton s charities and his americana band the boxmasters they have a much better site did you know that gary busey was one of google s top trending actors in i certainly didn t then i read a tidbit about it on his official page where it s superimposed over a shot of the mercurial actor himself if you haven t seen busey on reality tv or followed his bizarre thoughts on twitter then prepare yourself for the art of buseyisms in which he picks words creates original acronyms for them and pairs each one with a philosophical message here s a strange quirk of the web if you go to http kevincostner com you ll find an official website for the explorers guild volume one a passage to shambala an historical fantasy novel co authored by costner and released in late if you go to www kevincostner com you ll be directed to purchase his album famous for killing each other music from and inspired by hatfields mccoys released in if you stay on the latter page and why wouldn t you scroll down and click enter site that ll just lead you to an error page the world of celebrity websites works in mysterious ways the walking dead fan favorite keeps it simple he links to his imdb page his production company his photography books and his official social networks that s it in true daryl dixon form most of the black and gray page is devoted to the dos and don ts for contacting him there is no defined estimate for return mail if you need to make sure your mail arrived at its destination look into getting delivery confirmation there is no fan email address for norman norman is not on kik norman s son mingus is not on twitter facebook etc noted there s nothing outlandishly wrong with brosnan s site and it s admirable that he devotes so much space to his activism for environmental causes children s welfare and women s health it s just well it has a lot of quirks the news section includes stories taken word for word from deadline and the hollywood reporter an inexplicable photo gallery mixes vacation candids hollywood parties a shot of james bond walking away from an explosion and a particularly choice image of brosnan posing next to a large portrait of his younger self shirt undone to expose his hairy chest it s got the requisite biography written by someone else but there s also a short bit written by brosnan himself which ends with this paragraph this website is a new beginning let s see where it takes us to quote the last line of lawnmower man all the phones are ringing uh sure fonda s page is quite the mishmash one section touts her own social network the jane fonda community which includes a message board for topics such as grace and frankie sensuous women over the vietnam war and just fans there s also a shop that sells dvds of her films and workout videos as well as t shirts coffee mugs and tote bags featuring her raised fist mugshot the rest of the site is devoted to a pretty good blog that fonda started in which she updates occasionally to discuss her life career politics and health she even reads the comments here s an excerpt from her most recent entry another fun thing i did just before we started shooting was to attend a fundraiser for hillary clinton and the democratic national committee at the home of george and amal clooney my tooth fell out again but oh well dame helen mirren lays down the law with her welcome message i am not a twitterer or a facebooker so this is the best way to keep up with the developments in my life and career if any mirren heads actually rely on this site for news though they re way behind it hasn t had any major updates since february after a few years of sporadic blog posts tiny photos and a headshot of the woman who handles mirren s fan mail maybe that s not such a bad thing this one is fine if you want to read outdated pages about ed begley jr s environmental activism and acting career you d be better off with imdb and twitter the judging amy and leftovers star isn t messing around her site has a lot going for it thoughtful blog entries information on her career and charity work plus a lot of photos where it suffers is its baffling design i bet it d look damn cool if it were but today it just seems old flash animation check an overwhelming number of icons and links check an audio player that automatically plays songs by lucinda williams ani difranco sting the red hot chili peppers and nusrat fateh ali khan that s there too i d rather not risk riling up the star of under siege dark territory so i ll just say this if you click around this site you ll learn about seagal s martial arts his music his philanthropy and his customized guns don t kill people people kill people t shirt at first glance seinfeld s website looks like a smattering of random phrases such as bride magazine give my regards to your balls rhinoplasty stick with it though and it ll make sense each word correlates to a stand up bit and the site digs into seinfeld s massive library of performances to post three every day when i started doing tv i saved every appearance on every show i did he explains on the site i thought it might be fun to go through all of it and pick out three bits each day that still amuse me for some reason or another the layout is a little wonky you can only click on a handful of links on any given day but the real fun part is pondering the audience for this thing what kind of fan comes back every single day who are these people sorry the site looks a little old but cassidy s extremely loyal fans don t seem to care they comment on every post even the ones written by his web team a short blog entry about new year s eve got responses and who knows how many more were moderated away the site also has a bunch of weird subsections run by fans including a long list of some interesting facts about the partridge family idol david fractured a toe on his left foot while performing in little johnny jones in not without my daughter an episode of arrested development oscar bluth wears a jacket that reads david cassidy live presumably from a concert david was arrested and charged with dui on november the more you know i ll say this much about avid twitter user joe mantegna he has a better site than hall of fame quarterback joe montana whose page basically leads nowhere slim pickings from ray romano the comedian s site includes a reminder to watch hbo s vinyl the season finale aired in april four tour dates at the mirage and a handful of links for his stand up special miles to go nothing else not even a shout out to everybody loves raymond really one of hollywood s biggest action stars can t afford a better site is this the best a former governor can do in schwarzenegger s site has only added a few posts a statement about nancy reagan s death a judicial endorsement and a bunch of plugs for a t shirt that says come with me if you want to lift
