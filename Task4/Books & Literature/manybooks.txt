recently answered questions view all gabriela ramirez on what are the best books to read during lockdown i think you should read the thing about jellyfish i don t think it s on here but you can try to find it it s an amazing book frida s on how to write a fiction story of my own this is something that i have also wanted to do for a long time but have not i m sure that there are other published authors that can give better advice but mine would be to just start writing and see where it takes you sure it s not gonna be a bestseller or even very good unless you are a prodigy but it will give you a feel for how it is done getting your story in the hands of others and listening to feedback can also be invaluable if you have written a short story that you like and got good feedback on you can also submit it to websites that publish short stories just google east of the web and look at the short stories written by other people for inspiration read more frida s on what is the most life changing book that you have ever read en man som heter ove by fredrik backman or as english readers will know it a man called ove it showed me where my life was headed if i continued on my current path and prompted me to make a few changes especially in regards to how i treat other people anyway the story is about a man called ove who is a bit of a neighbor from hell until a young couple with

series books by sergei lukyanenko they are a fantastic read and please do not judge them by the movies named for the st two books night watch day watch the series is far far better than those films suggest i have only read them in translation but put several genre reading friends onto them aside from some great characters and a fascinating concept the fact that the series is mostly set in russia and written by a russian gives some fascinating insights into a culture that is only accessible to most of us through historical or stereotyped sources i highly recommend them read more sign up maggie
