reading notes in a good edition will explain many of the words historical events and customs of bygone times making the book easier to interpret these explanations might need to be updated for different generations as times and customs change and older ways are forgotten scholarship and continued curation of our best classic works should be supported paying for authoritative editions gets you the version that is closest to what the author intended with a little quick research you can determine which edition of a work is considered authoritative that means that a scholar or a team of scholars has studied and researched to find out which of many available variations of a particular work is closest to what the author intended works that are entered by volunteers into online databases may be accurate according to the copy they used to scan it but only an expert can decide whether that copy is the best most accurate version of an author s work experts should be paid for all the work they do to study and extend our knowledge of the works most valued in our culture when you buy an authoritative edition of a work you are helping preserve that work as a living part of our culture buying a recent edition of a translated work gets you the most up to date translation if you are reading a work that is translated from another language such as proust s in search of lost time or tolstoy s war and peace the e texts that are in the public domain available on free sites would probably have been translated before more recent translations will sound closer to today s
